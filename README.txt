Hi, Thank you for using this app. 

I created this app because I wanted to record my lectures and have them stored in an organized manner. I thought others might be interested in using it as well. This app is completely free to use. If you end up liking it, please let me know through my Instagram or GitHub. https://github.com/adolfzcoder/

You can manually add your modules to the 'courses.txt' file
 Also, if you would like to contribute, you can contact me at adolfdavid17@gmail.com . Feel free to buy me a Kassie burger ;). Developed by A.David Technologies.
